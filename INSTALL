Temporary instructions

1. the contents are intended to be copied into the root of the usual Inferno tree
	- we usually make a symbolic link /grid -> Inferno tree root on the hosted platform
		eg ln -s home/forsyth/inferno /grid
	  and scripts currently assume that
	- the platform-specific scripts are under Inferno's grid/scripts directory
	- worker nodes can have a much smaller installation than the normal Inferno tree
		- we'll supply instructions for that shortly
	- worker nodes need at least to have a private Inferno grid/slave directory
2. the Dis executable files live in dis/owen; they are supplied ready-made and being portable will work on all Inferno platforms
3. the application source is in appl/cmd/owen; {mk clean && mk install} in that directory to remake it
   (as usual for Inferno applications)
4. see the various .pdf files under doc
	there is as yet no very good tutorial
