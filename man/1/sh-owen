.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Owen
is a library for
.IR sh (1)
that provides a few shell functions to interact with the grid scheduler,
.IR owen-scheduler (1),
allowing jobs to be started and controlled.
.I Mountsched
must be used before any of the job control functions.
.TP 10
.BI ctl " id req arg ..."
.B Ctl
issues a control
.I request
(with the given arguments) to the job with the given
.IR id .
.TP
.BI fmtcat " fmt file"
Extracts data from
.I file
according to the
.I fmt
(see
.IR format (2)).
.TP
.BI ${job " jobtype arg ..." }
Allocates a new job to run the given
.I jobtype
with the given arguments,
and returns the job's unique ID as its result.
.TP
.BI job " jobtype arg ..."
Allocates a new job to run the given
.I jobtype
with the given arguments, and prints the job's unique ID on standard output.
.TP
.BI mountsched
Mounts the
.IR owen-scheduler (4)
name space at
.B /n/remote
(sic), using the configuration file in
.B $configfile
(default:
.BR /grid/slave/config )
to find the scheduler's network address and its attributes:
.B auth
(whether to use authentication); and
.B keyfile
(if authenticating, which key file to use).
If the configuration file defines
.BR schedfsaddr ,
that file service is mounted at
.BR /n/gridfs .
.TP
.BI "readconfig {" cmd "}"
Reads the configuration file named by
.B $configfile
(default:
.BR $root/config ).
It runs
.I cmd
for each configuration entry, setting shell variables
.B $attr
and
.B $val
to the attribute and value of the entry.
Typically
.I cmd
is an
.B if
command that executes different subcommands
depending on the value of
.BR $attr .
.TP
.BI start " jobtype arg ..."
Start a new job with the given job type and arguments;
print its ID.
