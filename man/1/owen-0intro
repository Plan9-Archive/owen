.SH NAME
owen-intro \- overview of the scheduler structure and configuration
.SH DESCRIPTION
The scheduler software is split into three different parts:
.TP 8
.B scheduler
runs on a single machine
for a given computational grid, and splits up jobs and hands them
out to clients as well as managing recovery from failure
.TP
.B client
runs on every client that will be a
.IR worker ,
and communicates with the scheduler to
receive tasks to process and return the results
.TP
.B monitors
allow users to
control and monitor the state of the scheduler and clients through
several graphical interfaces, currently one to create and monitor jobs,
and another to monitor and manage the worker nodes
.PD
.PP
There are also various job specific files which include the interfaces
to the scheduler, monitor and client, and also any data and/or
executables required by clients in order to process a task.
.SS Location
The scheduler software is found in a number of directories below the Inferno root:
.TP 8
.B /appl/cmd/scheduler
The source code for the scheduler, client and monitor
.TP
.B /dis/scheduler
The executables
.TP
.B /grid
All grid-related data and scripts, in separate subdirectories for each component.
.TP
.B /grid/master
The scheduler data, this includes temporary storage for running jobs,
some startup/configuration files and any server side job specific
scripts and data.
.TP
.B /grid/slave
The client data, this includes temporary storage for processing tasks
jobs, some startup/configuration files and any job specific client
side scripts.
.TP
.B /grid/scripts
This holds a directory for each host platform containing scripts
to start various parts of the system running.
.SS "Setup"
Before running the scheduler, monitor or client you must make sure that the files
.B /grid/master/config
and
.B /grid/slave/config
contain the correct address for the scheduler.
The address appears as the value of the attributes
.CW schedaddr
and
.CW schedfsaddr .
It is written in the form:
.IP
.BI tcp! "machine" ! "port"
.PP
where
.I machine
is the address (domain name or IP address) of the machine runnning the
scheduler and
.I port
is the port on which it listens. This can be done by editing the file using
.IR acme (1),
.BR wm/edit ,
or just using the
.B echo
command:
.IP
.B echo '(schedaddr "tcp!scheduler!6666")' > /grid/master/config
.B echo '(schedfsaddr "tcp!scheduler!1234")' >>/grid/master/config
.SS "Starting the scheduler"
Run the
.B /grid/master/startsched
script.
.PP
Alternatively, use the following commands:
.IP
.B styxlisten -Ah
.I scheduleraddress
.B scheduler/scheduler 
.IR args " ..."
.PP
where
.I args
are arguments supplied to the
.IR owen-scheduler (1),
and
.I scheduleraddress
is the address of the scheduler, as discussed above.
.SS Starting the monitor
Run the script
.B /grid/scripts/Inferno/jobmonitor
or use the following command:
.IP
.BI "scheduler/jobmonitor [" " args... " "]" " scheduleraddress"
.PP
where
.I args
are arguments supplied to the monitor as specified in
.IR owen-jobmonitor (1)
and
.I scheduleraddress
is the address of the scheduler.
.PP
Starting the node monitor
.IR owen-nodemonitor (1)
is similar, using
.B /grid/scripts/Inferno/nodemonitor
and
.BR scheduler/nodemonitor .
.SS Starting the client
To run the worker software
from within a normal instance of Inferno that is already running, run the
.B /grid/scripts/Inferno/worker
script or use the following commands:
.IP
.EX
ndb/cs
.br
.fi
scheduler/worker -Av
.I scheduleraddress
.EE
.PD
.PP
where
.I scheduleraddress
is the address of the scheduler.
.SS "Running the Client as a service under Windows 2000/XP"
.IP 1. 4n
From within Windows (not Inferno), run
.B /grid/scripts/Nt/install_service.bat
.IP 2.
Bring up the Services window
.BR (Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Services) .
.IP 3.
Select the
.B InfernoGridSlave
service and start it.
.PP
The client will subsequently start automatically after a reboot, unless that default is changed in the service manager.
.SS "Running the Client as a service under Windows NT4"
.IP 1. 4n
From within Windows (not Inferno), run
.B /grid/scripts/Nt/install_service_nt4.bat
.IP 2.
Bring up the Services window
.B (Control Panel->Services)
.IP 3.
Select the
.B InfernoGridSlave
service and start it.
.PP
The client will subsequently start automatically after a reboot, unless that default is changed in the service manager.
